  abstract = {Hierarchical models for regionally aggregated disease incidence data commonly
  involve region specific latent random effects that are modeled jointly as
  having a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The covariance or precision matrix
  incorporates the spatial dependence between the regions. Common choices for the
  precision matrix include the widely used ICAR model, which is singular, and its
  nonsingular extension which lacks interpretability. We propose a new parametric
  model for the precision matrix based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
  representation of the spatial dependence. Our model guarantees positive
  definiteness and, hence, in addition to being a valid prior for regional
  spatially correlated random effects, can also directly model the outcome from
  dependent data like images and networks. Theoretical results establish a link
  between the parameters in our model and the variance and covariances of the
  random effects. Substantive simulation studies demonstrate that the improved
  interpretability of our model reaps benefits in terms of accurately recovering
  the latent spatial random effects as well as for inference on the spatial
  covariance parameters. Under modest spatial correlation, our model far
  outperforms the CAR models, while the performances are similar when the spatial
  correlation is strong. We also assess sensitivity to the choice of the ordering
  in the DAG construction using theoretical and empirical results which testify
  to the robustness of our model. We also present a large-scale public health
  application demonstrating the competitive performance of the model.},

  abstract = {Introduced in this paper is a family of statistics, G, that can be used as a measure of spatial association in a number of circumstances. The basic statistic is derived, its properties are identified, and its advantages explained. Several of the G statistics make it possible to evaluate the spatial association of a variable within a specified distance of a single point. A comparison is made between a general G statistic and Moran's I for similar hypothetical and empirical conditions. The empirical work includes studies of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina and dwelling unit prices in metropolitan San Diego by zip-code districts. Results indicate that G statistics should be used in conjunction with I in order to identify characteristics of patterns not revealed by the I statistic alone and, specifically, the Gi and Gi* statistics enable us to detect local “pockets” of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics.},

abstract = {The health impact of long‐term exposure to air pollution is now routinely estimated using spatial ecological studies, owing to the recent widespread availability of spatial referenced pollution and disease data. However, this areal unit study design presents a number of statistical challenges, which if ignored have the potential to bias the estimated pollution–health relationship. One such challenge is how to control for the spatial autocorrelation present in the data after accounting for the known covariates, which is caused by unmeasured confounding. A second challenge is how to adjust the functional form of the model to account for the spatial misalignment between the pollution and disease data, which causes within‐area variation in the pollution data. These challenges have largely been ignored in existing long‐term spatial air pollution and health studies, so here we propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical model that addresses both challenges and provide software to allow others to apply our model to their own data. The effectiveness of the proposed model is compared by simulation against a number of state‐of‐the‐art alternatives proposed in the literature and is then used to estimate the impact of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter concentrations on respiratory hospital admissions in a new epidemiological study in England in 2010 at the local authority level. © 2015 The Authors.
